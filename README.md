Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of science used for developing , testing and maintaining software.
Importance of software engineering
Reliability - ensures software performs as expected without bias
Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow for wile maintaining high quality standards
Scalability and flexibility - it ensures the system can handle an incereased load without affecting performance
Security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity
As software systems grew in size and complexity, early approaches based on simple, linear coding became unmanageable.The introduction of structured programming in the 1960s (e.g., with languages like ALGOL and later C) helped break down code into more manageable blocks using functions and control structures.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) emerged in the 1970s and 1980s with languages like Smalltalk, C++, and later Java, allowing for better code organization, reuse, and scalability.
Mastering process
The realization that software engineering needed disciplined processes led to the development of methodologies like the Waterfall model in the 1970s, emphasizing structured phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
The 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of more iterative approaches, including the Spiral Model and Rational Unified Process (RUP), focusing on risk management and flexibility.
By the early 2000s, Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) transformed software development by promoting adaptability, continuous feedback, and collaboration.
Mastering machine
Early programming required direct machine code and assembly language, making software development highly complex and hardware-dependent.
The advent of high-level languages like FORTRAN (1950s), COBOL (1960s), and later C and Java allowed developers to write more abstract and portable code.
The rise of virtualization, cloud computing, and containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) in the 2010s further abstracted software from underlying hardware, enabling scalable and distributed applications.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope
Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification
Design - building the framework
Coding - converting software design into a tangible code
Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile methodology 
- Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.
Waterfall methodology
- Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility, changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
- Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
- maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
- reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
- create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
- confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
- discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
- create blueprint for the project.
- tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
- deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Importance:
IDEs provide a comprehensive set of tools that streamline the software development process, making coding, debugging, and testing more efficient. Key benefits include:

Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing
What It Is:
Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation. Typically, developers write automated tests for small code units like functions or classes.

Why It’s Important:
- Ensures that each unit of code works as expected.
-Helps detect bugs early in the development cycle.
-Makes debugging easier by pinpointing the exact location of an issue.
-Encourages modular and maintainable code.

Example:
Testing a function in a banking application that calculates interest rates to ensure it produces the correct results.

Common Tools:
JUnit (Java)
pytest (Python)
NUnit (C#)
2. Integration Testing
What It Is:
Integration testing verifies that different modules or components of a system work together correctly. It focuses on data flow between units rather than testing them in isolation.

Why It’s Important:
-Identifies defects in interactions between integrated components.
-Ensures APIs, databases, and third-party services work together as expected.
-Prevents issues caused by inconsistent data formats or unexpected dependencies.

Example:
Testing how a payment processing module interacts with the bank API and order system in an e-commerce application.

Common Tools:
Postman (for API integration testing)
Selenium (for web integration tests)
JUnit/TestNG (for Java integration testing)
3. System Testing
What It Is:
System testing evaluates the entire application as a complete system to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements.

Why It’s Important:
-Ensures the system works as a whole, beyond individual components.
-Validates performance, security, and usability of the entire application.
-Helps uncover system-wide issues, such as memory leaks or unexpected crashes.

Example:
Testing a social media application by logging in, posting a message, sending a friend request, and checking notifications to ensure all features function correctly.

Common Tools:
Selenium (for web applications)
JMeter (for performance testing)
TestComplete (for automated system testing)
4. Acceptance Testing
What It Is:
Acceptance testing determines whether the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment. It’s often conducted by end-users, clients, or a Quality Assurance (QA) team.

Why It’s Important:
-Ensures the software meets customer expectations.
-Validates that the system fulfills business use cases.
-Reduces risks of major defects after deployment.

Example:
A company launching a hotel booking app may conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT), where employees test different booking scenarios before release.

Common Types of Acceptance Testing:
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): End-users test the software in real-world scenarios.
Alpha Testing: Performed by in-house testers before release.
Beta Testing: Performed by external users before final deployment.
Common Tools:
TestRail (for test case management)
Cucumber (for behavior-driven acceptance tests)

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Write about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Write a 500-word article explaining how artificial intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry, focusing on patient diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and administrative automation."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
-Clarity – It specifies the topic (AI in healthcare) rather than the broad subject of "technology."
-Specificity – It highlights key areas to focus on (diagnosis, treatment, and administration).
-Conciseness – The word limit ensures the response is appropriately detailed without being too long or too short.
